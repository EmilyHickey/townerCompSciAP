The original Elevator was designed to use numbers to represent people
so the second one was a more object oriented version, where
people were an object.

Although I was unable to create a working version when I was in the class,
I stil feel it is a good project to show off as it was one
of the first truly object-oriented I  ever worked on, (alongside this
the errors in the class are syntax related)

I may come back to this someday and fix the errors I had.
